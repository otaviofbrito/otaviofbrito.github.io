## Hello! 👋

I'm **Otavio Brito**, a computer science student at Universidade Federal de Alfenas (UNIFAL) with a deep passion for technology.

## About Me

I'm a naturally curious person who thrives on exploring new technologies and solving challenging problems. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me enjoying a great cup of coffee ☕ while listening to some rock music 🎸 — the perfect combination for productivity!

## Technical Philosophy

My primary programming languages are **Python** and **Go**, but I don't believe in being confined to a single stack. I embrace a **language-agnostic approach** to software development, meaning I focus on choosing the right tool for each specific problem rather than forcing a preferred language into every situation. This mindset allows me to select technologies based on their proven effectiveness for the task at hand, whether that means leveraging Python's rich ecosystem for data processing, Go's performance for concurrent systems, or any other language that best addresses the challenge.

## Professional Experience

I currently work at [**iFood**](https://www.ifood.com.br/), Brazil's largest food delivery company, as part of the **Generative AI Platform team** (GenPlat). Our team is responsible for building and maintaining iFood's internal generative AI infrastructure, which democratizes access to large language models across the company.

GenPlat serves as a unified platform for consuming AI models within iFood, providing:
- Secure and scalable infrastructure for running both external LLM providers and internal deployments
- Governance and monitoring of AI usage with full auditability
- Tools for teams to easily integrate generative AI into their solutions
- Support for multiple platforms including Databricks, IDEs, and CLI environments

The platform currently processes around **68 million requests per month** and **100 billion tokens**, supporting over 230 teams across 100+ different AI models. It's been instrumental in powering various products, from automated customer support systems to innovative features like voice-assisted shopping and AI-enhanced product descriptions for restaurant partners.

## Current Focus

I'm deeply invested in **MLOps** and **ML Engineering** topics, focusing on building reliable, scalable, and production-ready machine learning systems. I also contribute to open-source projects — you might spot my avatar on [**LiteLLM**](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), a Python framework I occasionally contribute to!

## Dreams & Aspirations

> *"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page."* — Saint Augustine

My dream is to travel around the world, experiencing different cultures, meeting amazing people, and collecting stories from every corner of the globe 🌍✈️
